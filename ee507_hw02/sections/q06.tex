\section{Problem 6}
An experiment has four outcomes $A, B, C $ and $D$ which have probabilities $P(A)=0.4$, $P(B)=0.3$, $P(C)=0.2$, and $P(D)=0.1$. We define a random varialbe $x$ as follows: $X(A) = 1$, $X(B) = 5$, $X(C) = 2$, $X(D) = 1$. Also, we define the event $Z = \set{A, B, C}$. Please answer the following questions:

\begin{enumerate}[6a.]
	\item Find and plot the CDF of $X$.
	\item What is the probability that $2<X<6$?
	\item Find and plot the probability mass function (pmf) of $X$.
	\item Find the CDF of $X$ given $Z$ has occurred.
	\item What is the probability of $Z$, given that $X>1.5$?
\end{enumerate}
