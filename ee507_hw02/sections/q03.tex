\section{Problem 3}

A randomly selected student in an engineering class id diligent with probability $0.3$, and lazy with probability $0.7$. A diligent student completes all of her homework with probability $0.9$ and does not do so with probability $0.1$. Meanwhile, a lazy student completes all homework with probability $0.5$ and does not do so with probability $0.5$. A student who completes all homework receives an $A$ grade with probability $0.6$, and receives a $B$ grade with probability $0.4$ (irrespective of whether the student was diligent or lazy). A student who doesn't complete all homework receives an $A$ grade with probability $0.3$, a $B$ grade withe probability $0.4$ and an $F$ grade with probability $0.3$ (again, irrespective of whether the student was diligent or lazy).\\
Please answer the following questions.\\

\begin{enumerate}[a.]
	\item What is the probability that a randomly selected student is diligent, completes all their homework and receives an $A$ grade?
	\item What is the probability that the student completes all of their homework?
	\item What is the probability that the student receives an $A$ grade?
	\item Given that a randomly selected student completed all their homework, what is the probability that the student was lazy?
	\item Given that a randomly-selected student received an $A$ grade, what is the probability that the student is lazy?
	\item Is the event that a student passes the course (receives an $A$ or $B$ grade) independent of the event that the student is lazy?
	\item Is the event that a student receives a $B$ grade independent of the event that the student is lazy? 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Solution}

Experiment S: A student is randomly selected from an engineering class.

\begin{align}
	\text{Let, Event } D &= \set{\text{"Selected student is Diligent"}} \nonumber\\
	\text{$\implies$ Event } \bar{D} &= \set{\text{"Selected student is Lazy"}} \nonumber\\
	\text{Let, Event } H &= \set{\text{"Selected student did all of their homework"}} \nonumber\\
	\text{$\implies$ Event } \bar{H} &= \set{\text{"Selected student did NOT do all of their homework"}} \nonumber\\
	\text{Let, Event } A &= \set{\text{"Selected student receives an $A$ grade."}} \nonumber\\
	\text{Let, Event } B &= \set{\text{"Selected student receives a $B$ grade."}} \nonumber\\
		\text{Let, Event } F &= \set{\text{"Selected student receives an $F$ grade."}} \nonumber \Sadey
\end{align}

For reference, \cref{fig:decisionTree} is a graph which displays all possible variations of a randomly chosen student (or in terms of probability theory all events with non-zero probabilities).
