\section{Problem 4}
An experiment has three outcomes $A, B,$ and $C$, which have probabilities $P(A)=0.5, P(B)=0.3$ and $P(C)=0.2$. You repeat this experiment $100$ times, independently. Please answer the following questions.
\begin{enumerate}[4a.]
	\item What is the probability that outcome $A$ occurs on exactly $50$ trials.
	\item What is the probability that the outcome $A$ occurs on $50$ trials, outcome $B$ occurs on $25$ trials, and outcome $C$ occurs on $25$ trials?
	\item Given that the outcome $A$ occurred on exactly $60$ trials, what is the probability that $A$ occurred on the first trial? How about $B$?
\end{enumerate}
