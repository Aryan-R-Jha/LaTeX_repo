\chapter{Branch Flow Model: Relaxations and Convexification}

In \cite{bfm01} the authors came up the Relaxed Branch Flow Model, and showed that in the case of Tree/Radial networks, the Relaxed Model can solve for the unique optimal solution, including the bus angles, and in the case of weakly meshed networks, there is a mechanism for extracting the bus angles from the relaxed solution, to find out its unique solution, if it exists.
