\begin{frame}{Conclusion}
	Autocorrelation and Variance of the detrended bus voltage time series signal performed satisfactorily as early warning signs of Critical Slowing Down.
	
	These statistical parameters may lose their effectiveness as EWS when the sampling window is outside the `suitable' range.
	In this case this range may be said to be between $1$ second to $15$ seconds.

\begin{frame}{Future Work}
	\begin{itemize}[<alert@+>]
		\item Examine CSD symptoms on line currents.
		\item Perform the analysis on bigger power grid models
		\item Attempt to construct an algorithm which can determine the `Time to Bifurcation' for any particular power grid (supplied as a model) if given a stream of PMU data containing grid state variables.
	\end{itemize}
