\begin{frame}{Procedure}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Accessed a bunch of real-world frequency time-series data and plotted their:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item bulk distribution (pdf) 
				\item auto-correlation curves
			\end{itemize}
		in order to demonstrate that:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item grid frequencies often exhibit significant deviation from gaussianity
			\end{itemize} autocorrelation can be a reasonable indication of grid steady-state stability.
		\item Obtained explanation for the \textit{signature dynamics}	of each grid.
		\item Then implemented and tested the IEEE 9 Bus System in PSSE for symptoms of Critical Slowing Down as an Early Warning System. 		
	\end{itemize}
