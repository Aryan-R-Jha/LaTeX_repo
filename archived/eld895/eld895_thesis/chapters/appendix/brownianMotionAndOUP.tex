Scientist Robert Brown quoted the term `Brownian motion' to describe the random yet not chaotic motion of pollen grains suspended in water \cite{brownianMotion}.

The Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Process (named in honour of Physicists Leonard Salomon Ornstein and George Eugene Uhlenbeck) is a special case of the Brownian Motion.
