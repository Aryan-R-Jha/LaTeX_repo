\section{A Comparison of select Correlation Coefficients}

\subsection*{Pearson's Correlation Coefficient}

Pearson's Correlation Coefficient, often denoted using the parameter $\rho$, is one of the go-to methods for computing the degree of correspondence between two datasets or time-series, etc. The value of $\rho$ varies between positive and negative unity, i.e. $-1 \leq \rho \leq +1$, where the more the value is skewed towards either extreme end, the more correlated the two datasets or time-series are. The sign determines if the correlation is positive or negative. A value of $\rho$ closer to $0$ implies little to no correlation between the two variables.

\Cref{tab:pearsonCorrCoeff01} gives a quick overview of this correlation coefficient.
