\section{Example Figures and Tables}

Fig.~\ref{fig:iitd} shows a simple figure for illustration along with
a long caption.  The formatting of the caption text is automatically
single spaced and indented.  Table~\ref{tab:sample} shows a sample
table with the caption placed correctly.  The caption for this should
always be placed before the table as shown in the example.

    \caption {Two IITD logos in a row.  This is also an
      illustration of a very long figure caption that wraps around two
      two lines.  Notice that the caption is single-spaced.}
