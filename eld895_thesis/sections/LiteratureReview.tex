For offline analysis of the grids, archived frequency time-series data of several real-world grids via downloaded from these websites and/or papers: \cite{lrydin01, lrydinGithub, ce2019, ce2020, tokyo2017, tokyo2020, nordic2018, nordic2019, ukNationalGridESOData}. Schafer et al's paper \cite{schafer01} was referred to for the analysis of these grids. Their paper  analyzes how almost all grids show a significant level of deviation from the commonly used assumption that power demand fluctuations follow a particular variation of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck's Process where the noise component $\zeta(t)$ follows the Gaussian distribution around a nominal mean.
Most of the recent literature analyzing the effects of the phenomenon of Critical Slowing Down on various dynamical systems, including but not limited to: power grids, ecological population dynamics, predator-prey ecosystems, prediction of epileptic seizures in patients, climate systems, financial markets, prediction of conversion of vegetation area into deserts, and so on credit the review made by Scheffer et al in \cite{schefferEarlyWarningSignalsForCriticalTransitions}. The paper lists out systems in which Critical Slowing Down has been observed and provides accessible mathematical explanations behind its working, such as why there is an increase of autocorrelation and variance of state variables of real-world physical processes as the system approaches a `critical bifurcation'. The mathematical term has also been appropriately called as `critical transition' or `tipping point' by the author of \cite{kuehnMathematicalFrameworkForCriticalTransitions}, whose paper explains various normal forms of bifurcations (Fold, Hopf, Saddle Node, Transcritical, Pitchfork) via the concept of fast-slow stochastic systems. For developing a working understanding of bifurcation theory, university lecture notes by \cite{nathanKutzNotesOnBifurcationTheoryAndNormalForms} were utilized.  

For real-time/online analysis, authors in \cite{ghanvati01} have utilized PSAT to simulate a steadily stressed power grid and have demonstrated that the computation of autocorrelation of detrended bus voltages and the computation  of variance of detrended line currents can function as reliable Early Warning Signs of increasing instability. The detrending is required in order to filter any measurement noise from the data, which may skew the computed statistical parameters towards bogus values. Authors in \cite{sanchez01} test various power grids which are/were driven towards bifurcation and demonstrate that an increase of autocorrelation and variance values of bus voltages (tested in simulation) and grid frequency (tested on the time-series data measured at the Bonneville Power Administration minutes before the blackout of 10 August 1996) can reliably predict the impending bifurcation early enough for mitigating actions to be taken by the grid operator.
