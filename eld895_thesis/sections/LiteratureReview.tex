For real-time/online analysis, authors in \cite{ghanvati01} have utilized PSAT to simulate a steadily stressed power grid and have demonstrated that the computation of autocorrelation of detrended bus voltages and the computation  of variance of detrended line currents can function as reliable Early Warning Signs of increasing instability. The detrending is required in order to filter any measurement noise from the data, which may skew the computed statistical parameters towards bogus values. Authors in \cite{sanchez01} test various power grids which are/were driven towards bifurcation and demonstrate that an increase of autocorrelation and variance values of bus voltages (tested in simulation) and grid frequency (tested on the time-series data measured at the Bonneville Power Administration minutes before the blackout of 10 August 1996) can reliably predict the impending bifurcation early enough for mitigating actions to be taken by the grid operator.
