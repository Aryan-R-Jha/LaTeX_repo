Unlike transient faults in a power grid which can generally be attributed to a sudden but tangible anomaly (corrective outcomes of protection mechanisms, sudden failure of a generator or transformer, line faults), steady state instabilities can be hard to detect until they accumulate over time to manifest as a major upset to the grid \verb|CITE HERE FOR FRENCH GRID COLLAPSE IN August 2020| or make the grid less robust/more susceptible to collapses \cite{schafer01}.
