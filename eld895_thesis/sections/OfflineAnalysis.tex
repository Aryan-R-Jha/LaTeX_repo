Various frequency time-series archives for a diverse set of real-world grids was obtained and analyzed by plotting their bulk distribution probability density functions and autocorrelation decay functions. The data for most European and US grids was conveniently curated by the authors of \cite{lrydin01, lrydinGithub}. For the other regions of the world, \cite{nordic2018, nordic2019} had the data for the Nordic grids, \cite{tokyo2017, tokyo2020} for Tokyo grid, \cite{ce2019, ce2020} for Continental European grid and \cite{ukNationalGridESOData} for the UK Grid.
