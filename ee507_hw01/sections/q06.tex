\section{Problem 6}
A simple dartboard is shown below:

\begin{figure}[!ht]
	\centering
	\import{../figures/}{dartBoardPdf.pdf_tex}
	\caption{A dart board with given scores for hitting different regions.}
	\label{fig:dartBoard}
\end{figure}

Your favourite EE 507 instructor throws a dart at the board. He hits the board with probability $0.7$ and misses the board with probability $0.3$. Given that he hit the board, he is equally likely to hit any point on it. He receives a score of $0$ if he misses the board, and receives the score shown if he hits the board.

\begin{enumerate}[a.]
	\item What are the outcomes of this experiment? How many are there?
	\item What are the events in this experiment? How many are there?
	\item What is the probability that your instructor's score is more than $3$?
	\item Let's say we repeated the experiment twice, independently. What is the probability that the score is greater than $3$ on the first try, and less than or equal to 3 on the second try?\\
	Also what is the probability that the two scores are different?
\end{enumerate}
