\section{Problem 3}
Consider any uncertain experiment, and let $A$, $B$, and $C$ be three events defined for the experiment. Please prove the following equalities or inequalities. In doing so, you may use the three axioms, any equalities/inequalities developed in class, standard set theory and algebra concepts, and earlier parts of the problem.

\begin{itemize}
	\item
	\!  %one-sixth of a quad's space, the Stack Exchange answer did this so I'm doing the same too.
	$
	\begin{aligned}
		P(A\bar B) = P(A) -  P(AB) \nonumber
	\end{aligned}
	$
	\item 
	\! If $A$ is contained in $B$, then $P(A) \leq P(B)$.
	\item  
	\! 
	$
		\begin{aligned}
			P(A+B) + P(\bar A) + P(\bar B) - P(\bar A + \bar B) = 1 \nonumber
		\end{aligned}
	$ 
	\item
	\!  
	$
		\begin{aligned}
			P(AB) + P(\bar A C) + P(\bar B \bar C) \leq 1 \nonumber
		\end{aligned}
	$ \\[5pt]
	Please also give an example showing that the bound can be achieved.

			\begin{tabular}{L L L L}
				\text{To Prove: } & P(A \bar{B}) &= P(A) - P(AB) &  \\
				\text{We know that } & P(A) &= P(A \bar{B}) + P(AB) & \text{(Law of Total Probability)} \\
				\text{Rearranging equation:} & P(A\bar{B}) &= P(A) - P(AB) & \text{Hence Proved.}
