\section{Problem 7}
Let's say an experiment has three outcomes.

\begin{enumerate}[a.]
	\item How many events can be defined for this experiment?
\end{enumerate}

	
Now we say we repeat the experiment twice (once more), independently.

\begin{enumerate}[a.]\setcounter{enumi}{1}
	\item How many outcomes does the combined experiment have?
	\item How may events can be defined for the combined experiment?
	\item How many events for the combined experiment can not be derived from the cartesian products for the individual experiments? Please give an example.
\end{enumerate}
