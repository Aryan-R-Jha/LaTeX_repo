\section{Problem 7}
Let's say an experiment has three outcomes.

\begin{enumerate}[a.]
	\item How many events can be defined for this experiment?
\end{enumerate}

	
Now we say we repeat the experiment twice (once more), independently.

\begin{enumerate}[a.]\setcounter{enumi}{1}
	\item How many outcomes does the combined experiment have?
	\item How may events can be defined for the combined experiment?
	\item How many events for the combined experiment can not be derived from the cartesian products for the individual experiments? Please give an example.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Solution}

Let the experiment be called $E_1$ which has the three outcomes be $A, B \text{ and } C$ i.e. $\Omega$ = \{A, B, C\}\\
\begin{enumerate}[a.]
	\item \# Events = $2^n$ where $n$ is the cardinality of the sample space $\Omega$. \\
	Here $n = 3$ and therefore \# Events = $2^3 = 8$.
\end{enumerate}	
	Let the combined experiment be called $E_2$.
	The outcomes of this combined experiment will be represented by the new sample space $\Omega_2$ = \{AA, AB, AC, BA, BB, BC, CA, CB, CC\}.
\begin{enumerate}[a.]\setcounter{enumi}{1}
	\item \# Outcomes = Cardinality ($n_2 = n^2$) of the sample space $\Omega_2$. \\
	Here $n_2 = 3^2 = 9$.
	\item \# Events = $2^{n_2}$ \\
	Here $n_2 = 9$ and therefore \# Events = $2^9 = 512$.
	\item \# Events of the combined experiment which can be defined from the cartesian products of the individual experiments = $2^n * 2^n$ = $2^{2n}$ = $2^6$. \\
	Total \# Events of the combined experiment = $2^{n^2}$ = $2^9$.\\
	Therefore, \# Events which cannot be defined from the cartesian products of the individual experiments = $2^{n^2} - 2^{2n}$ = $2^9 - 2^6$ = $512 - 64$ = $448$.\\[10pt]
	Examples for an event of $E_2$ which can be formed from the cartesian products of the events of $E_1$:
	
	\newcommand\set[1]{\{#1\}}
	
	\begin{align*}
		\set{A} \times \set{A} &= \set{AA} \nonumber\\
		\set{A, B, C} \times \set{A} &= \set{AA, BA, CA} \nonumber\\
		\set{A, C} \times \{B\} &= \set{AB, CB} \nonumber
	\end{align*} 

	Examples for events of $E_2$ which can NOT be formed from the cartesian products of the events of $E_1$:

	\begin{align*}
		& \set{AB, BC, CA} \nonumber\\
		& \set{AA, CB} \nonumber\\
		& \set{BC, CB} \nonumber
	\end{align*} 
	\end{enumerate}
