\section{Problem 1}
 
 All of you travelled to Pullman and WSU to begin your education here (maybe by airplane, maybe by car, maybe even by bus or on foot if you grew up in the area). Please consider your latitude (how far North or South you are) as a function of time on this journey. Before you started travelling, this time signal was subject to uncertainty. Please sketch two possible instances of this signal, explaining why each result may occur.
