\section{Problem 4}
Consider an experiment that has four outcomes, $A$, $B$, $C$, and $\square$.

\begin{enumerate}[a.]
	\item How many events can be defined for this experiment? What are they?
	\item  What is the sample space for the experiment?
	\item For this part, assume that $P(\{A, B, \square\}) = 0.8$, $P(\{A, C\}) = 0.4$ and $P(\{A, \square\}) = 0.4$.\\
	Please find the probabilities of all events defined for this experiment.
	\item For this part, assume that the probabilities $P(\{A, B, \square\})$ and $P(\{A, C\})$ are known, and that we can measure the probability of exactly one more event. Please find all other events such that the knowledge of the three events' probabilities allows us to compute the probabilities of all events.
\end{enumerate}
